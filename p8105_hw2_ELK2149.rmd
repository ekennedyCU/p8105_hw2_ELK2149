#join unemployment

pols_snp_unemp_df = 
  left_join(pols_snp_df, unemployment_df, by = c("year", "month"))

pols_snp_unemp_df

```

The variables in this dataset are: `r (names(pols_snp_unemp_df))`. The data was collected between the dates of `r min(pols_snp_unemp_df$year)` and `r max(pols_snp_unemp_df$year)`. The dataset has `r nrow(pols_snp_unemp_df)` rows and `r ncol(pols_snp_unemp_df)` columns. pols_month_df contains data relating to the number of federal representatives, senators, state governors and president who represent each party in a given month and year. snp_df contains data on the S&P stock market score, by month and year. unemployment_df provides the percent of unemployment in the united states by month and year. 


*** Problem 2 ***

```{r}

  mutate(trash_wheel_name = "Gwynnda")

```


```{r}
total_trash_df = 
  bind_rows(mr_trash_df, professor_trash_df, gwynnda_trash_df)
```

The variables in this dataset are: `r (names(total_trash_df))`. The data was collected between the dates of `r min(total_trash_df$year)` and `r max(total_trash_df$year)`. The dataset has a total of `r nrow(total_trash_df)` observations. The total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Dumpster was  `r sum(professor_trash_df$weight)` tons. The total number of cigarette butts, collected by Gwynnda Trash Dumpster was `r format(sum(gwynnda_trash_df$cigarette_butts[gwynnda_trash_df$year == 2022 & gwynnda_trash_df$month == "June"]), scientific = FALSE)`.
